# cp2k_stm

STM repository
==================

Files with the results of an energy calculation with **cp2k**. These are the eigenvalues and eigenvectors (EIGENXXX file)
and the Hamiltonian (KSXXX).

The file input.inp contains the input used to compute the files.

The file job.sh is the one used to submit the job in Young.
